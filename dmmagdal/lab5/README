I've had some weird errors happen. Git gives me a runtime error but unix timeshare gies me a compile error. So yeah. It'd be helpful if you didnt just tell people to google it because google is not very simple in it s explaination. With a little more time and someone who would actually look at the code, I could find the bug.
